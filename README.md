# Distributed Tokenized Real Estate Protocol: DTREP

## Abstract

This document specifies a protocol for the tokenization of commercial real estate assets on EVM-compatible blockchains, with particular focus on Base network implementation. DTREP establishes a formal framework for mapping physical property assets to fungible tokens, managing rental payment flows from tenants to token holders, and facilitating decentralized governance of tokenized properties. The protocol introduces a novel mechanism for automatic, atomic distribution of rental yields and implements an innovative approach to token liquidity through deterministic liquidity pool interactions.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional commercial real estate investment suffers from significant inefficiencies including illiquidity, high capital requirements, and opaque governance structures. DTREP addresses these limitations through a tokenization framework that enables fractional ownership, instantaneous rental yield distribution, and governance rights proportional to token holdings.

The protocol consists of five core components:
1. Asset Tokenization Mechanism
2. Rental Payment Processing System 
3. Yield Distribution Algorithm
4. Liquidity Management Protocol
5. Decentralized Governance Framework

This specification describes the theoretical underpinnings, formal requirements, and implementation details for each component.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Contract Topology

DTREP implements a system of interconnected smart contracts, each with narrowly defined responsibilities:

```
PropertyRegistry
├── PropertyToken (ERC-20)
├── RentalPaymentProcessor
│   └── PaymentRouter
├── YieldDistributor
├── LiquidityManager
└── GovernanceController
```

The system architecture follows a modular design to maximize upgradeability and minimize attack surfaces. Each contract interfaces with others through explicitly defined function calls, reducing interdependencies.

### 2.2 Data Flow Model

Data and value flows through the system as follows:

1. Physical real estate asset → PropertyRegistry → PropertyToken issuance
2. Tenant → Cryptocurrency payment → RentalPaymentProcessor
3. RentalPaymentProcessor → YieldDistributor → Token holders
4. Token buyer/seller → LiquidityManager → Liquidity pool
5. Token holders (>10%) → GovernanceController → Property management decisions

## 3. Asset Tokenization Mechanism

### 3.1 Property Registration

Each commercial property is registered in the PropertyRegistry contract with the following attributes:

```solidity
struct Property {
    bytes32 propertyId;           // Unique identifier
    string legalDescription;      // Legal property description
    uint256 squareFootage;        // Size in square feet
    uint256 appraisedValue;       // Current appraised value
    address propertyTokenAddress; // Associated ERC-20 token contract
    uint256 totalTokenSupply;     // Total number of tokens issued
    uint256 expectedAnnualYield;  // Projected annual yield
    bool isActive;                // Property status flag
}
```

### 3.2 Token Issuance

For each registered property, a dedicated ERC-20 token contract is deployed. The token supply represents 100% ownership of the property, with the following tokenomics:

```
Token Name: Property-[propertyId]
Token Symbol: PROP-[propertyId]
Decimals: 18
Total Supply: Determined at issuance (typically 1,000,000 tokens)
```

The token contract includes standard ERC-20 functionality with additional metadata:

```solidity
function getPropertyDetails() external view returns (
    bytes32 propertyId,
    string memory legalDescription,
    uint256 squareFootage,
    uint256 appraisedValue,
    uint256 expectedAnnualYield
);
```

## 4. Rental Payment Processing System

### 4.1 Payment Acceptance

The RentalPaymentProcessor contract accepts rental payments in any cryptocurrency through a crypto-agnostic interface:

```solidity
function processRentalPayment(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    address paymentToken,
    uint256 paymentAmount,
    uint256 rentalPeriod
) external returns (bool success);
```

For native blockchain currencies (e.g., ETH), a separate payable function is available:

```solidity
function processNativePayment(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    uint256 rentalPeriod
) external payable returns (bool success);
```

### 4.2 Payment Verification

The PaymentRouter sub-contract verifies incoming payments against expected rental amounts:

```solidity
function verifyPayment(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    address paymentToken,
    uint256 paymentAmount,
    uint256 rentalPeriod
) internal view returns (bool isValid, uint256 conversionRate);
```

The PaymentRouter maintains an oracle connection to verify cryptocurrency conversion rates for accurate yield calculation.

### 4.3 Payment Events

Each successful payment emits an event for off-chain tracking and verification:

```solidity
event RentalPaymentProcessed(
    bytes32 indexed propertyId,
    address indexed tenant,
    address paymentToken,
    uint256 paymentAmount,
    uint256 convertedAmount,
    uint256 timestamp,
    uint256 rentalPeriod
);
```

## 5. Yield Distribution Algorithm

### 5.1 Yield Calculation

For each payment received, the YieldDistributor calculates proportional yields for token holders:

```solidity
function calculateYieldDistribution(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    uint256 paymentAmount
) internal view returns (mapping(address => uint256) memory distributions);
```

The distribution is calculated atomically at the time of payment according to:

```
tokenHolderYield = (tokenHolderBalance / totalPropertyTokenSupply) * paymentAmount
```

### 5.2 Atomic Distribution

The yield distribution process executes in a single transaction, ensuring all token holders receive their proportional share instantaneously:

```solidity
function distributeYield(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    address paymentToken,
    uint256 paymentAmount
) external onlyRentalProcessor returns (bool success);
```

Each distribution triggers an event:

```solidity
event YieldDistributed(
    bytes32 indexed propertyId,
    address indexed tokenHolder,
    address paymentToken,
    uint256 yieldAmount,
    uint256 timestamp
);
```

### 5.3 Failed Distribution Handling

In case a single distribution fails (e.g., due to contract execution reversion), the system implements a fallback mechanism:

```solidity
function claimUnclaimedYield(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    uint256[] memory paymentIds
) external returns (bool success);
```

## 6. Liquidity Management Protocol

### 6.1 Liquidity Pool Structure

Each property token is paired with a base currency (typically ETH or a stablecoin) in an automated market maker liquidity pool:

```solidity
function createLiquidityPool(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    address baseCurrency,
    uint256 initialTokenAmount,
    uint256 initialBaseCurrencyAmount
) external returns (address liquidityPoolAddress);
```

### 6.2 Token Burn Mechanism

When tokens are sold into the liquidity pool, they are not transferred to another owner but are burned and converted into base currency liquidity:

```solidity
function burnAndLiquidate(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    uint256 tokenAmount,
    uint256 minBaseCurrencyReturn
) external returns (uint256 baseCurrencyReturned);
```

This mechanism eliminates the need for a buyer to be matched with a seller directly, providing instant liquidity for token holders.

### 6.3 Token Acquisition

New token holders acquire tokens through the reverse process:

```solidity
function acquireTokens(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    uint256 baseCurrencyAmount,
    uint256 minTokenReturn
) external payable returns (uint256 tokensAcquired);
```

This function mints new tokens against the provided base currency, maintaining the pool's invariant.

## 7. Decentralized Governance Framework

### 7.1 Governance Rights Allocation

Token holders with at least 10% of the total supply for a specific property are automatically granted governance rights:

```solidity
function hasGovernanceRights(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    address tokenHolder
) public view returns (bool);
```

### 7.2 Proposal Creation

Eligible token holders can create governance proposals:

```solidity
function createProposal(
    bytes32 propertyId,
    string memory description,
    bytes calldata executionData,
    address targetContract,
    uint256 votingPeriod
) external returns (uint256 proposalId);
```

Proposals can address:
- Rental price adjustments
- Property sale authorization
- Capital improvements
- Property management changes
- Dividend policy modifications

### 7.3 Voting Mechanism

Voting power is proportional to token holdings:

```solidity
function castVote(
    uint256 proposalId,
    bool support
) external returns (uint256 votingPower);
```

A proposal passes when a majority of voting power (not simply token count) supports it within the designated voting period.

### 7.4 Proposal Execution

Passed proposals are executed atomically:

```solidity
function executeProposal(
    uint256 proposalId
) external returns (bool success);
```

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Re-entrancy Protection

All state-changing functions implement re-entrancy guards:

```solidity
modifier nonReentrant() {
    require(!_reentrancyStatus, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
    _reentrancyStatus = true;
    _;
    _reentrancyStatus = false;
}
```

### 8.2 Access Control

The system implements role-based access control:

```solidity
modifier onlyPropertyAdmin(bytes32 propertyId) {
    require(
        _propertyAdmins[propertyId][msg.sender],
        "AccessControl: sender is not property admin"
    );
    _;
}
```

### 8.3 Oracle Failure Contingency

In case of oracle failures for cryptocurrency price feeds, the system implements a failsafe mechanism:

```solidity
function getConversionRate(
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB
) public view returns (uint256 rate, bool isValid);
```
